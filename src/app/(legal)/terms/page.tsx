      <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700">
        By using Eclipsed Citadel’s services, you agree to the following terms. These terms are designed to protect both parties and ensure clarity in the content creation process.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Services Provided</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Eclipsed Citadel provides AI-assisted creative content including videos, graphics, blog posts, social captions, and marketing materials. Services are delivered according to the plan selected by the client (Starter, Bronze, Silver, Gold, or À La Carte).
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Ownership & Licensing</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        All content created for paying clients is fully licensed for commercial use. We reserve the right to use anonymized or sample versions of your content for promotional or educational purposes unless you request otherwise in writing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Delivery Timelines</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Deliverables will be completed within the timeframe outlined in your plan (e.g., 3–7 business days). Delays due to incomplete intake forms or late revision feedback may affect timelines.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Revisions</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Each plan includes a set number of revision rounds. Gold plans allow unlimited minor revisions within scope. Major changes may incur an additional fee.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Subscriptions may be canceled at any time before the next billing cycle. Refunds are only granted if no content has been delivered. Otherwise, a credit may be issued toward future services.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Client Responsibilities</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We use artificial intelligence tools (e.g., OpenAI, Canva, Pictory) to generate creative content. By using our services, you acknowledge and accept the use of these tools in the production process.
